				<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
				<p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible, broken support, and abandoned browsers.</p>	
				<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the and the major browser creators.</p>

				<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
				<p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
				<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

				<p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the. This may seem daunting at first if never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
				<p>Download the sample  to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, submit half-finished work) upload your file to a web server under your control.  to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>
